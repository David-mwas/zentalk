## Background

Depression and loneliness are significant challenges facing youth in Kenya and worldwide. Many people find it hard to talk to someone or open up due to factors such as fear of judgment, lack of safe spaces, or absence of close relationships. This project seeks to address these issues by creating an entanglement chatbot that fosters meaningful interactions and emotional connections.

## Problem Statement

Despite modern communication technologies, many people struggle to establish and sustain meaningful relationships. Conversations often remain shallow, lacking intimacy and emotional depth. Hectic schedules and conflicting commitments make it challenging to maintain relationships, leading to feelings of loneliness and detachment.

## Proposed Solution

The Entanglement Chatbot (ZENTALK) aims to bridge the gap between digital communication and real human connection. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP), empathetic modeling, and interactive storytelling, ZENTALK will facilitate real and emotionally engaging discussions, encouraging individuals to open up and share their issues without fear of judgment.
